# anomalyDetection-DBSCAN

Anomaly detection (AD) is crucial in identifying outliers in tabular data, with applications in fraud detection, cybersecurity, and healthcare. Unlike image or text data, tabular data presents unique challenges, including noisy and irrelevant features, heterogeneous data types, limited labeled data, and the need for interpretability. 

We have used PIDForest, GAM Model, PCA and DBSCAN to detect the anomaly (outliers).
